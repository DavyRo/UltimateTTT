Rules of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe
-----------------------------
1. 	Each player takes turns adding their marks to the board.
	The Ultimate Board is made up of 9 boards in a 3x3 formation,
	which are each made up of 9 boxes arranged in a 3x3 formation.

2. 	You may only play in the board that corresponds to the Box the
	other player last played in. For example, if you play in Box 1
	(top-center), your opponent's next move must be in Board 1.

3. 	A player can win a Board by being the first to achieve a full
	row, column, or diagonal with their marks within a singular Board.
	This is exactly the same as standard Tic-Tac-Toe. 

4.	If a player is sent to a Board that has already been won, they
	must still play in that board. Furthermore, once a Board has been
	won, it will remain won by that player (even if their opponent
	gains a victory condition on that Board). In other words, the
	first person to win the Board, will own that Board for the
	entire Game.
	
5. 	A player can win the Game by achieving a full row, column,
	or diagonal of won Boards on the Ultimate Board.
6. 	If a player is sent to a Board with no available Boxes,
	the player may choose any available Board on the Ultimate Board
	to play in.

How to Play
-----------
The game will begin by asking what players will be playing the game.
Inputting 0 will run a game between 2 Computer-based Players.
They will always select a random square.
Inputting 1 will run a game between 1 Computer-based player and
1 Human player. The human player will go second, and will be 
assigned the 'O' mark.
Inputting 2 will run a game between 1 Computer-based player and
1 Human player. The human player will go first, and will be 
assigned the 'X' mark.
Inputting 3 will run a game between 2 Human players.

After the game begins, players will be asked to select boxes
to play in. The upper-left box is Box 0, and continues to increment
across the rows, before going to the next. In other words, the numbers
increment much like reading a book. The diagrams below illustrate what number
each Box and Board are assigned.

Analysis and Design
--------
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is just a larger version of Tic-Tac-Toe. As such,
the UltimateBoard is simply constructed from 9 Boards. There are also methods
for checking the UltimateBoard for victory, a new datafield in each Board that
lists the winner of that Board, and a more complex printing method that prints
each line one at a time.

The game can be played in AI vs AI, AI vs Human, and Human vs Human modes.
I was not able to implement the extra credit winning strategy for the AI,
however, I did implement the extra credit method to print the available
Boxes playable on any given turn.

The game works. It will crash, however, if a char or non-int is input. As long as
the inputs are ints, however, the code will run without error.
